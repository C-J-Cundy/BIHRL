Code for the paper [Exploring Hierarchy-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05037).

## Note
This code comes with no guarantees, only works on Python 2 and is very specialized to the particular environments used in the paper. 
It is here mainly for reproducibility reasons. 
I've improved my programming ability quite a bit in the years since this project, and I would implement this algorithm very differently if I had to do it today
